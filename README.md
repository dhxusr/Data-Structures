# Data-Structures
This repository is a personal project focused on deeply understanding data structures by implementing them from scratch in Python.
Each structure is designed with correctness, efficiency, and clarity in mindâ€”no libraries, no shortcuts, just core logic.
The goal is not only to learn how these structures work, but to internalize their behavior, performance, and practical trade-offs through code and experimentation
